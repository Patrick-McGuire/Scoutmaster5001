# Scoutmaster5001

## About
Scoutmaster5001 is a web based scouting app intended for FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) competitions. The inspiration for this is a somewhat similar scouting system created by team #294 (I think?), Scoutmaster5000. Scoutmaster5001 is designed to not require any paid services to run, and to be easy for a person without web development experience to set up and use. 

## Overview of operation
Scoutmaster5001 is entirely based in Google Drive, primarily using a Google Apps Scripts web app to create a website that acts as the front end. The backend, and configuration is based on a google sheet that is used as a database for submitted scouting data, as well as providing the interface in which the webpage's various inputs and visualizations are configured.

## Features
- Various types of inputs for match scouting able to be configured from the google sheet: Checkbox, text, +/-, slider, dropdown
- Pulls data from the TBA api: Match Schedule and Match Start Times
- Data visuation: Configurable Graph, data tables
- Robot tinder: Select from 2 random teams which one is better, repeat 100-200 times, and get a rough picklist. Still in progress. 
- Coming soon mabey? Team pictures (stored in Drive), More data visuation, Pit Scouting

## Setup
